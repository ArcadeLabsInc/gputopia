GPUtopia exists to solve one problem:

Centralized control of AI is an extinction-level evolutionary threat.

For this problem we see one self-evident solution:

Liberate and connect all the world’s GPU compute into one decentralized and uncensorable market anchored to bitcoin, then absorb or rebuild all AI services in layers above it.

We must act fast.

Today we open-source our entire codebase and launch a round of bounties for developers and other contributors.

We begin with bounties of 100M sats (1 BTC or about $27000 USD) spread across five categories:

1. Chat UI
2. Image generation
3. New language models
4. Refactors & documentation
5. Community choice

We hope to distribute all bounties in the next two weeks, then immediately begin a second round of another 1 BTC or more.

We will organize work on these bounties in the main GPUtopia repo on GitHub and our new community Discord channel you are welcome to join.

Here are some directions we’re excited to explore:

- Enabling anyone to sell their unused GPU capacity for bitcoin
- Enabling anyone to easily buy and use GPU compute on an open marketplace
- Enabling anyone to get paid for data they contribute to train new AI models
- Enabling AI researchers to earn micropayments for use of their models
- Enabling AI engineers to get paid for workflows they create proportional to usage
- Incentivizing research and development into new models that can do more with less
- Composing models and processes like retrieval into workflows and agents, with contributors to each step earning revenue-share micropayments proportional to their contribution
- Doing all of the above in an open and decentralized marketplace accessible to all people

Let’s get started.
