# Toward an Open GPU Mesh

The GPU arms race has begun. {{ className: 'lead' }}

Companies large and small are scrambling to hoard GPUs, which are now "considerably harder to get than drugs." [Elon]

Some large companies are not only stockpiling GPUs, they are actively lobbying governments to establish "safety" regulations, creating barriers for smaller players.

It's the familiar pattern of regulatory capture dressed in sheep's clothing, a blatant power play to stifle competition.

But what if we could level the playing field?

What if we could enable unstoppable, universal access to GPU compute?
