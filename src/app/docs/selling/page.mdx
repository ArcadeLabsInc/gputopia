# Selling Compute

You connect your GPU to perform jobs for buyers and get paid in bitcoin. There are two ways to connect your GPU:

1. Use a Chrome web browser. You can use your GPU to perform jobs without installing any software. This is the easiest way to get started, but may earn less than our worker software.
2. Install the GPUtopia 'workerbee' software. The agent worker automatically connect your GPU to the marketplace and start performing jobs.
