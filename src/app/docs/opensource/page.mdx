As of October 3, GPUtopia has open-sourced all relevant code. ([Read the announcement](/blog/opening))

Core functionality is split across three GitHub repos:

  - NextJS v13, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shad-ui
- [workerbee](https://github.com/ArcadeLabsInc/workerbee) - The AI worker
  - Python with [executables](https://github.com/ArcadeLabsInc/workerbee/releases) for Linux, Windows and soon MacOS
- [queenbee](https://github.com/ArcadeLabsInc/queenbee) - The coordinator of AI workers
  - Python
  - Workers connect to our queenbee by default, but anyone can run their own

All code is alpha or beta quality and under heavy development.

We use the [AGPL3](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-affero-general-public-license-v3-agpl-3-0) license which lets you use and modify however you like, but requires you to open-source any changes you make to the code. We think it's important that all relevant code starts open and stays open.
