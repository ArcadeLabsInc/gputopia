# Buying Compute

<Note>Under construction</Note>

# Topping up your account

1. Coming soon

# Access via chat interface:

1. Click **Buy > AI Chat** when logged in. Inference is billed for the currently loaded model.

# Access via openai-compatible endpoint:

1. Click **Buy > API Key** when logged in
2. Copy the API key and use it wherever you would use an OpenAI API key
3. Change the base url to `https://queenbee.gputopia.ai/v1`

Some codebases append the /v1 in code, so you may need to try just `https://queenbee.gputopia.ai`

# Supported interfaces

- Openai compatible Fine Tuning, Chat Inference and Embeddings are currently supported

## Model names

- Use hugging face model names, or your own fine-tuned model name (for now)
- Feel free to use a publicly available URL to any GGUF file for an inference model name instead (our workers will download/run it)
- Use fastembed:BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5 (or any other fastembed model) for very fast /v1/embeddings endpoint use
- Use repo/model:filter format for any hugging face model.
  - A worker will load your model.
  - First time usage will be slow as the model propagates to different workers
  - The more you use it, the faster it will get (will gain priority over time)
- For example: TheBloke/zephyr-7B-beta-GGUF:Q5_K_M works fine, and is comparable, in many ways, to gpt3

## Python example code:

<div>
```python
import openai

# Set up the OpenAI client

openai.api_key = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
openai.api_base = "https://queenbee.gputopia.ai/v1"

# Use the model with the chat completion endpoint

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
model="TheBloke/vicuna-7B-v1.5-GGUF:Q4_K_M",
messages=[
{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
{"role": "user", "content": "Translate the following English text to French: 'Hello World'"},
]
)

print(response.choices[0].message['content'].strip())

````
</div>


## Node example code:

<div>
```js
const OpenAIApi = require('openai');

const openai = new OpenAIApi({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_GPUTOPIA_API_KEY',
  baseURL: 'https://queenbee.gputopia.ai/v1'
});

async function getCompletion() {
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "TheBloke/vicuna-7B-v1.5-GGUF:Q4_K_M",
    messages: [
      {role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant."},
      {role: "user", content: "Translate the following English text to French: 'Hello World'"}
    ]
  });

  console.log(response.choices[0].message.content.trim());
}

getCompletion();

</div>
